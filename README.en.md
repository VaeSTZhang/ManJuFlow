## Product Positioning

**Dramora｜剧作工坊** is a cinematic script workbench for transforming ideas and source texts into structured short-drama scripts.

The current product focus is script creation and text adaptation. It is not positioned as an image generation, video generation, or automated film production system at this stage.

Dramora is designed for writers, short-drama planners, manhua-style content teams, and creative operators who need an editable and reviewable script workflow before downstream media generation.

`ManJuFlow` was the early internal project codename. The public repository and local engineering directory now use `Dramora`; scripts, backend packages, frontend package names, and API paths are not renamed as part of the brand update.

## Core Workflows

### Idea Generation

Generate a structured short-drama script from story ideas, character relationships, or hook-driven concepts.

Best for:

- original short-drama concepts;
- early story validation;
- character relationship drafts;
- quick editable episode outlines.

### Text Adaptation

Adapt film scripts, novels, web fiction, or long-form story text into short-drama pacing.

Best for:

- film script to short-drama adaptation;
- long script compression;
- novel / web fiction adaptation;
- source text organization before further creative work.

          -> Film Script Adaptation
          -> Novel / Web Fiction Adaptation
  -> Script Adaptation
      -> Long-text organization and short-drama adaptation
```

Storyboarding, prompt generation, image generation, assets, and tasks remain in the engineering foundation, but they are not emphasized in the current boss-demo and market-trial main interface.

## Engineering Foundation

- FastAPI backend;
- Pydantic data contracts;
- React + Vite + TypeScript frontend;
- AppShell / Sidebar / Toast workbench foundation;
- Idea-to-script baseline workflow;
- Text organization / script adaptation workspace;
- Mock Word script upload;
- input limits and backend validation;
- frontend-friendly API error display;
- Document Export Schema;
- three-entry short-drama generation schema / registry / mock service / endpoint foundation;
- mock-first local demonstration strategy.

## Technical Architecture

Backend:

- Python;
- FastAPI;
- Pydantic;
- `schemas` / `services` / `routers`;
- versioned prompt files;
- OpenAI-compatible `LLMClient`;
- mock / llm generation modes;
- pytest coverage.

Frontend:

- React;
- Vite;
- TypeScript;
- AppShell;
- Sidebar;
- script creation home;
- script adaptation workspace;
- Chinese-first UI;
- browse-before-login and operate-after-login demonstration gate.

## Local Development

Use your own local clone path.

Backend:

```bash
cd /path/to/Dramora
bash scripts/dev_api.sh
```

Frontend:

```bash
cd /path/to/Dramora/apps/web
npm run dev
```

Backend tests:

```bash
cd /path/to/Dramora
python -m pytest tests/api
```

Frontend build:

```bash
cd /path/to/Dramora/apps/web
npm run build
```

Do not commit `.env`, API keys, customer scripts, real server addresses, or sensitive cooperation materials.
